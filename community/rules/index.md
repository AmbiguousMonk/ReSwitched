# ReSwitched Community Discord Rules

These are the rules, guidelines, and code of conduct for participation in the ReSwitched community.  
**By participating—posting, commenting, reacting, contributing, or editing—you agree to these rules.**

## Rules

Breaking these rules will result in immediate action, and they are enforced strictly  
**Notice**: The rules aren't there to allow us to god-mod over everyone. Even staff will excercise caution over prejudice, but will none the less act swiftly when necessary.

The staff acts in the best interest of you both as individuals and as a community.  
Do not assume that we act in bad faith because we enforce these rules to you—it is likely that your behavior made our actions Necessary. Please understand.

Don't whine about staff or these rules in public. As per rule 3, do talk privately to staff if you wish to discuss a staff action.

1. Read the rules.
    - Read __all__ the rules before participating in chat. *Not reading the rules is not an excuse for breaking them.*
    - It's suggested that you read channel topics, pins, and the VVV-FAQs before asking questions as well, as some questions may have already been answered in those.
2. Be nice to each other.
    It's fine to disagree; it's __not__ fine to insult or attack other people.
    - You may disagree with anyone, but you should try to keep your arguments to __opinion__ and not __people__.
        - Voicing disagreements which create an unsafe or unwelcome atmosphere is not permitted.
        - *Avoid vitriol*. Flame-wars will be shut down the moment we notice them.
    - Constant antagonistic behavior is considered uncivil and *appropriate action* will be taken.
    - Discriminatory behavior—including sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist behavior—will not be tolerated.
        - In severe cases, such as those that involve use of slurs, hate speech, or targeting of an individual, **such behavior will be considered grounds for an *immediate ban***.
    - Harassment of other users is not tolerated, and will be acted upon as soon as it is brought to our attention.
3. Staff will handle issues directly.
    We have at least one staff member available at all times. Staff have colored roles, and online staff are usually above the other uses in the sidebar. 
    - __If you have concerns about another user__, *please take up your concerns with a staff member* (someone with a colored role in the sidebar) *in private*. **Don't publically call other users out.**
    - __If you have concerns with a staff or moderation action__, *do not complain about it in public.* Take up your issues in in private with the staff.
    - __If you feel that you were wrongly kicked, banned, or otherwise removed from the community__ and you cannot contact the staff, *fill out an [appeals form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScN7YRN9PY_sn26p8lXk_dJgUBYlx3Qwq_6EYxT5TMR0ie6yQ/viewform)* and we will try to get back to you soon enough.
    - __Going to other communities and making a scene__ about a staff action, especially one against you, *will not favor you in an appeal*, and may count against you in rule 5.
    - __If you need to discuss something privately__ with all staff, *inform a staff member.* We will open a channel for your input.
        - This also counts for if you need to discuss a vulnerability or exploit you have discovered in private.
    - __We will maintain a best effort of confidentiality among staff.__ However, if one staff member is contacted about a ReSwitched issue, *all staff members may be made aware of your concerns* in order to work together towards a solution or resolution.
4. We will global-ping
    Global pings are an easy way to be notified of especially important news regarding Switch.

    We ask that you not supress global pings if you wish to make use of homebrew tools and participate in ReSwitched, however we understand that people are typically not happy with having their Discord light up.

    All other news, which doesn't require mass-notification, is posted to __#news__.
    1. @everyone mentions
        - From time to time, **we may mention __@everyone__ in the server.**
        - We do this when we feel something important is going on that requires attention.
        - Important things include, but are not limited to: community changes, new developments in Switch hacking, time-critical announcements, and hardware or software changes which jeopardize the possibility of future homebrew.
    2. @here mentions
        - From time to time, *we may mention __@here__ in the server.**
        - We do this when there is something that we need community participation for, such as analysis of console data, or a pre-release which we are running through a final Q.A.
    3. Miscellaneous
        - Staff will not abuse this to unnecessarily or randomly ping people.
        - To disable notifications for these pings, supress them in "ReSwitched server menu → Notification Settings".
            - *On desktop: [see this GIF](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/290068297238446082/397605479154450450/2017-12-23_20-57-21.gif)
        - When a global ping happens, the channel it occured in will be temporarily **locked down** to avoid noise from random users.
            - Don't use the other channels to discuss the ping unless it's appropriate to do so.*
        - Complaining about these pings may result in a ban.
