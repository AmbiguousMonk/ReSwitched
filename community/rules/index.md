# ReSwitched Community Discord Rules

These are the rules, guidelines, and code of conduct for participation in the ReSwitched community.  
**By participating—posting, commenting, reacting, contributing, or editing—you agree to these rules.**

## Rules

Breaking these rules will result in immediate action, and they are enforced strictly  
**Notice**: The rules aren't there to allow us to god-mod over everyone. Even staff will excercise caution over prejudice, but will none the less act swiftly when necessary.

The staff acts in the best interest of you both as individuals and as a community.  
Do not assume that we act in bad faith because we enforce these rules to you—it is likely that your behavior made our actions Necessary. Please understand.

Don't whine about staff or these rules in public. As per rule 3, do talk privately to staff if you wish to discuss a staff action.

1. Read the rules.
    - Read __all__ the rules before participating in chat. *Not reading the rules is not an excuse for breaking them.*
    - It's suggested that you read channel topics, pins, and the VVV-FAQs before asking questions as well, as some questions may have already been answered in those.
2. Be nice to each other.
    It's fine to disagree; it's __not__ fine to insult or attack other people.
    - You may disagree with anyone, but you should try to keep your arguments to __opinion__ and not __people__.
        - Voicing disagreements which create an unsafe or unwelcome atmosphere is not permitted.
        - *Avoid vitriol*. Flame-wars will be shut down the moment we notice them.
    - Constant antagonistic behavior is considered uncivil and *appropriate action* will be taken.
    - Discriminatory behavior—including sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist behavior—will not be tolerated.
        - In severe cases, such as those that involve use of slurs, hate speech, or targeting of an individual, **such behavior will be considered grounds for an *immediate ban***.
    - Harassment of other users is not tolerated, and will be acted upon as soon as it is brought to our attention.
3. Staff will handle issues directly.
    We have at least one staff member available at all times. Staff have colored roles, and online staff are usually above the other uses in the sidebar. 
    - __If you have concerns about another user__, *please take up your concerns with a staff member* (someone with a colored role in the sidebar) *in private*. **Don't publically call other users out.**
    - __If you have concerns with a staff or moderation action__, *do not complain about it in public.* Take up your issues in in private with the staff.
    - __If you feel that you were wrongly kicked, banned, or otherwise removed from the community__ and you cannot contact the staff, *fill out an [appeals form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScN7YRN9PY_sn26p8lXk_dJgUBYlx3Qwq_6EYxT5TMR0ie6yQ/viewform)* and we will try to get back to you soon enough.
    - __Going to other communities and making a scene__ about a staff action, especially one against you, *will not favor you in an appeal*, and may count against you in rule 5.
    - __If you need to discuss something privately__ with all staff, *inform a staff member.* We will open a channel for your input.
        - This also counts for if you need to discuss a vulnerability or exploit you have discovered in private.
    - __We will maintain a best effort of confidentiality among staff.__ However, if one staff member is contacted about a ReSwitched issue, *all staff members may be made aware of your concerns* in order to work together towards a solution or resolution.
4. We will global-ping
    Global pings are an easy way to be notified of especially important news regarding Switch.

    We ask that you not supress global pings if you wish to make use of homebrew tools and participate in ReSwitched, however we understand that people are typically not happy with having their Discord light up.

    All other news, which doesn't require mass-notification, is posted to __#news__.
    1. @everyone mentions
        - From time to time, **we may mention __@everyone__ in the server.**
        - We do this when we feel something important is going on that requires attention.
        - Important things include, but are not limited to: community changes, new developments in Switch hacking, time-critical announcements, and hardware or software changes which jeopardize the possibility of future homebrew.
    2. @here mentions
        - From time to time, *we may mention __@here__ in the server.**
        - We do this when there is something that we need community participation for, such as analysis of console data, or a pre-release which we are running through a final Q.A.
    3. Miscellaneous
        - Staff will not abuse this to unnecessarily or randomly ping people.
        - To disable notifications for these pings, supress them in "ReSwitched server menu → Notification Settings".
            - *On desktop: [see this GIF](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/290068297238446082/397605479154450450/2017-12-23_20-57-21.gif)
        - When a global ping happens, the channel it occured in will be temporarily **locked down** to avoid noise from random users.
            - Don't use the other channels to discuss the ping unless it's appropriate to do so.*
        - Complaining about these pings may result in a ban.
5. No raids.
    *Don't brigade, raid, or otherwise attack other people or communities. Don't discuss participation in these attacks. This may warrant an immediate permanent ban.
6. Maintain quality, supress noise.
    - Don't spam.
        - For excessively long text, use a service link [0bin](https://0bin.net/)
    - Channels may be locked down in the event that a discussion or argument gets out of hand, if there is an attack or spammer present, or if we need to get the attention of users in the channel quickly (including with a global mention).
        - When a channel is locked down, especially if it is because of an argument or off-the-handle discussion, do *not* bring the topic to another channel.
            - Doing so will result in moderation action against you and/or your posts.
        - **Off-topic content goes to #off-topic**.
            - Keep low-quality content like memes and shitposting out of the other channels.
            - __#off-topic__ is for *high quality* discussion. ;)
            - Access to the __#off-topic__ channel is through the "__@community__" role, and...
                - is given to users, by staff, when we feel that you are contributing positiviely to the community and the quality of discussion, and we are participating well.
                - is not given by request.
                - is not given based on any particular contribution (e.g., to a dump request, or to the wiki, code, or by reporting a bug).
                - is given to you, the user, when we feel that you have *earned it*.
                - can be removed from anyone, for any reason, absolutely arbitrarily.
                - may be reinstated, if we feel you've continued to earn it.
                - will be removed __permanently__ if you are breaking the rules, the community guidelines, or code of conduct.
                - may be removed from many or all people at a time, especially if the channel is too crowded, or if the conversation is worthy of a lockdown.
            - **Not having access to __#off-topic__ is *not* an excuse for posting off topic stuff in other channels.**
                - If you feel the need to post off-topic random things not related to Switch hacking, and you aren't going to participate in ReSwitched and be well-behaved enough to get access to __#off-topic__, don't waste our time; *join another community*.
            - This server primarily speaks English, and we expect that you communicate clearly.
                - We will try our best to understand you if English is not your first language or if you do not speak it well or at all and rely on machine translation. We try to remain accessible and friendly.
                    - However, if you do break the other rules, we will still enforce them regardless.
