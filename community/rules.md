**By participating—posting, commenting, reacting, contributing, or editing—you agree to these rules.**

## Rules
Breaking these rules will result in immediate action, and they are enforced strictly
**Notice**: The rules aren't there to allow us to god-mod over everyone. Even staff will excercise caution over prejudice, but will none the less act swiftly when necessary.

The staff acts in the best interest of you both as individuals and as a community.
Do not assume that we act in bad faith because we enforce these rules to you—it is likely that your behavior made our actions Necessary. Please understand.

Don't whine about staff or these rules in public. As per rule 3, do talk privately to staff if you wish to discuss a staff action.
